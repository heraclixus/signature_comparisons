# Signature Based Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Comparison

This repository explores the design space of signature-based methods for time series generation, focusing on non-adversarial training approaches. We systematically compare different combinations of generators, loss functions, and signature computations.

## Design Space Overview

The signature-based deep learning landscape can be decomposed into three key dimensions:

1. **Generator Architecture**: How paths are generated
2. **Loss Function**: How quality is measured  
3. **Signature Computation**: How signatures are calculated

## Complete Design Space Matrix

### 🏗️ Generator Architectures (Truly Generative Only)

| Generator Type | Description | Implementation | Strengths | Generative Quality |

## 🎪 Expected Discoveries

Based on our analysis, we hypothesize:

1. **Signature-aware architectures** (CannedNet) will perform better with signature-based losses
2. **T-statistic losses** will be more robust than scoring rules for distribution matching
3. **Neural SDEs** will excel for time series with known physical dynamics
4. **Truncated signatures** will provide the best efficiency/performance trade-off
5. **Cross-method combinations** (e.g., Neural SDE + T-statistic) may yield surprising benefits

This comprehensive exploration will provide the first systematic comparison of signature-based deep learning methods and establish best practices for different application domains.
