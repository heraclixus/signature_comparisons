Every example is split into two files, a `.ipynb` and a `.py` file. Just run the `.ipynb` file to reproduce the experiments. (Its corresponding `.py` file just defines the objects it needs, and will be imported.)

There are two other files here. First there is `base.ipynb`, which is run by every other notebook, and just performs path hacking to get access to the packages folder. And then there is also `utils.py`, which is exactly what it sounds like.
